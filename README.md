# Translate Messenger - Android Final Project
  A messaging app that allows users to communicate in different languages. This app is for users who travel internationally that need to communicate with others in their own language as well as the language of the place they have traveled to. They need this app in order ease communications with people who don't speak the same language, simplifying their interactions with other people. 
  
  The user will enter a message in their own language and the app will translate the message and send it to the other user. The app will have a feature that allows the user to view messages in their language as well as the other language it was translated to. Other features the app will include: image translate, common responses suggestions, and a widget that allows the user to communicate with others in person in the language of the place they are visiting.
